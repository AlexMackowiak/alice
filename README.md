# Alice

Digital Assistant for Linux, inspired by Cortana, Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant

### Why did I decide to do this?

Because I got bored one day and started writing it.

### What technologies is this built on?

Alice is written in Python, with the libraries Numpy, Scikit, Scikit-learn, and
Google Speech Recognition.

### What can it do so far?

It can shut down your computer, lock your computer, close whatever window you
have currently active, and change your volume.

### That's a pretty small list of features...

I know... It's a hobby project that's fairly new and I don't have much time to
work on it with school and stuff. The planned features are:

 - Opening files
 - Closing arbitrary windows that are open on your computer
 - Opening URLs
 - Monitor CPU activity, memory usage, and temperatures
 - Run system commands that you tell it to
 - Facebook integration
 - Google service integration
 - Monitoring and updating outdated packages
 - Really anything else that I feel like adding...

### Why is it named Alice?

In the light novel / anime Sword Art Online: Alicization arc, Alice is a fully
sentient AI that truly mimics human-ness.

### Your code is crap, you boosted animal...

I know :( If you want to make any improvements / fixes, make a pull request
please!
